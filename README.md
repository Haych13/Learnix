## Welcome to Learnix

Learnix is an open-source program made with JavaFX to help you learn how to use the Command Line Interface on GNU/Linux devices. Most of what's learnt here will also work on Unix.

**Why Learnix over CodeAcademy?**
Learnix is an all-in-one software that doesn't need the internet to function, Learnix will be completely open-source so it can always be kept upto date if somethine changes or new is added. 

 **Where can I download Learnix?**
 

You can't, at least not yet, as Learnix is still being developed I'd like it to be in a more complete state before I make the repo public

 **When is the release?**

Soon. Learnix is still under development and not ready for a fullrelease just yet. You can download the Alpha Build here though: https://drive.google.com/file/d/19oxkc0MBx48rcMCsF5nWUvYGLlQI40Fg/view?usp=drivesdk



**Install Requirements:**

Windows and MacOS - Java 9

GNU/Linux - Oracle Java 9 (JavaFX is not installed by default on OpenJDK, hence the requirement for Oracle Java 9):

sudo apt update

sudo apt install oracle-java9-installer

sudo apt install oracle-java9-set-default


Check your version with 

java -version
