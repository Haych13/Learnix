## Welcome to Learnix

Learnix is an open-source program made with JavaFX to help you learn how to use the Command Line Interface on GNU/Linux devices. Most of what's learnt here will also work on Unix.

**Why Learnix over CodeAcademy?**
Learnix is an all-in-one software that doesn't need the internet to function, Learnix will be completely open-source so it can always be kept upto date if somethine changes or new is added. 

 **Where can I download Learnix?**
 

You can't, at least not yet, as Learnix is still being developed I'd like it to be in a more complete state before I make the repo public

 **When is the release?**

Soon. Learnix is still under development and not ready for release just yet. I am aiming for June/July 2018 for a first release.
