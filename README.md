Learnix is an open-source program made with JavaFX to help you learn how to use the Command Line Interface on GNU/Linux devices. Most of what's learnt here will also work on Unix.

## Why Learnix over Alternatives?
Learnix is an all-in-one software that doesn't need the internet to function, Learnix will be completely open-source, so it can always be kept up-to date if something changes or new is added. 


## When is the full release?

Soon. Learnix is still under development and not ready for a full release just yet.
